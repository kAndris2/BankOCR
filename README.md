Hello,
My program provides a solution to the first 4 tasks.

The program starts from the "Program.py" file.
The code works from "raw_numbers.txt" where I put about 500 entries.

After running the program, two files are created that contain the solutions to the third and fourth tasks.
"number_status(task_3).txt" and "number_status(task_4).txt"

The definitions include a brief description in which I tried to summarize what they were doing.
